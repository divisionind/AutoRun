AutoRun
--------
A windows program which adds autorunning (or automatic key holding of any kind) universally
to all games. To use it, just hold down the keys you would like to stay pressed and then
press the PAUSE key. You can now take your hand off the keyboard, and the keys will remain
pressed until you press a key on the keyboard again.

### Other notes / Known issues
This program is currently in the early stages of development and will likely change a lot
as time passes. There is also an issue where keys are not able to be released in some
programs manually. In order for them to be released, they must be pressed again manually
then released.

*NOTE: My main reason for writing this was to explore low level inputs on Windows so how
I do stuff here is not the best or easiest in all cases but instead its in service of 
that original idea.*
